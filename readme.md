# Expensify

This repository contains code that I wrote alongside a React/Redux front end course I enrolled in. The code is deployed to heroku and can be found [here](http://jeronimo-react-expensify.herokuapp.com). As I suspect not many people will access the application, please be patient when you access the site for the first time, as the heroku dynos will take some time to spin up.
